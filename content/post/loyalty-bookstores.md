We like books. We like you. And we’re ready to bring the best books and events to our community. We are aiming to be the Mid-Atlantic’s neighborhood spot for wonderful books and unique home goods, gifts, and programming. Our staff and our selection highlight the diverse voices and creatives that make our communities great. When we think about what to feature in our store we focus on how we live in our homes. We provide books and goods for the home because, well, books are home.
