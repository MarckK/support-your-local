Qualia Coffee Roasters is a small-batch roaster located in Washington DC focusing on carefully sourced single-origin estate and micro-lot beans. Roasting frequently and in small batches allows us to emphasize the natural variety of coffees from around the world. Our "farmers market" approach, delivering all of our coffee to customers within three days of roasting, means we can focus 
on what brings out the most flavor in each bean without worrying about shelf life.
